Given some text we can split it into geometric pieces (rectangles or squares), 
and store the pieces in more files. Given the following text

Fair into the great Atlantic Ocean, 
by the third day - when the sun is high,
set sail to the east, there ye shall walk 
the deck seven times lengthwise, then ye 
shall walk the deck seven times more. 
When this is done, call the name of the 
Mermaid from the Seven seas, and the Island 
shall appear before ye.

The following Split Pattern

AB
CD

will yield the following into 4 files.


file A                   file B
-------------------------------------------------

Write a program - that given a piece of text, will split it into the appropriate
amount of files according to a given Split Pattern.

The rules for the Split Pattern are

* No same letters may appear with another letter in between. 
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AB
  AB
  AB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AB
  CB
  AB

* A letter chain must never start further to the right than a consecutive chain 
  of the same letters.
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AAA
  ABB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AAA
  ABB
  BBB

The same program shall also be able to reconstruct the text from the given files
and the split pattern.
