Given some text we can split it into geometric pieces (rectangles or squares), 
based on what can be called a 'Split Pattern', the pieces of the text can then
be stored in more than one file(s). 
Later, given the file(s) and the split pattern, the original text can be 
reconstructed.
 
Example: Given the text "HELLO, WORLD!"

The following Split Pattern
AB

would generate two files A.txt and B.txt each one containing the following.
A.txt
 HELLO,

B.txt
 WORLD!


The split pattern
AABBCC

would generate three files A.txt, B.txt and C.txt containing the following.
A.txt
 HELL

B.txt
 O WO

C.txt
 RLD!

If the input contains more than one line, the split pattern is applied onto
all the input as such.

Example: Given the text "HELLO\nWORLD" <-- read as two lines

The following Split Pattern 
AB

would generate two files A.txt and B.txt each one containing the following.
A.txt
 HE
 WO

B.txt
 LLO
 RLD

The following split pattern "A\nB" 

would generate two files A.txt and B.txt containing the following.
A.txt
 HELLO

B.txt
 WORLD

Write a program - that given text and a Split pattern as input,
will split the text into the appropriate amount of files according, with
the appropriate contents.

The rules for the Split Pattern are

* No same letters may appear with another letter in between. 

  Thus, this is a legal pattern
  AB
  AB
  AB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern
  AB
  CB
  AB

* Only rectangles or squares of same letters are allowed

  Thus, this is a legal pattern
  AAB
  AAB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern
  AAB
  AAB
  BBB

* The split pattern must be an non-jagged matrix.
  Thus, this is a legal pattern
  ABB
  CCC

  and this is NOT a legal pattern
  ABB
  CC

* The dimensions of the pattern may never be greater than the dimensions of the
  text itself: Meaning, neither the amount of columns, or rows may be greater
  than the amount of rows and columns in the text. Given "HELLO\nWORLD"
  the dimensions of the text are (2 5) 2 rows, 5 columns, when viewed like
  a matrix.
  Thus, this is a legal pattern 
   AB
  and, this is a legal pattern
   A
   B

  and this is NOT a legal pattern (3 1)
   A 
   B
   C

  likewise, this is also NOT a valid pattern (1 6)
   ABCDEF

The same program shall also be able to reconstruct the text from the given files
and the split pattern.

You shall of course also have pattern validation for your program.
