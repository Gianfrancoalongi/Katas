Given some text we can split it into geometric pieces (rectangles or squares), 
and store the pieces in more files. Given the following text

HELLO, WORLD!

The following Split Pattern

AB

would generate two files A.txt and B.txt each one containing the following.
A.txt
 HELLO,

B.txt
 WORLD!

The split pattern 

AB
AB

would generate two files A.txt and B.txt each one containing the following.
A.txt
  HEL
  WOR

B.txt
  LO,
  LD!

Thus, the split pattern dictates how the data is "reshaped" as well as the
geometric dimensions.
Given a split pattern as 

ABC
ABC

We would get three files A.txt, B.txt and C.txt containing the following.
A.txt
 HE 
 WO

B.txt
 LL 
 RL 

C.txt
 O,
 D!

Write a program - that given a piece of text, will split it into the appropriate
amount of files according to a given Split Pattern.

The rules for the Split Pattern are

* No same letters may appear with another letter in between. 
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AB
  AB
  AB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AB
  CB
  AB

* A letter chain must never start further to the right than a consecutive chain 
  of the same letters.
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AAA
  ABB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AAA
  ABB
  BBB

The same program shall also be able to reconstruct the text from the given files
and the split pattern.
