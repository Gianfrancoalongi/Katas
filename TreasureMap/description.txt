Given a block of text, we can split it into geometric pieces
by using a template, the 'Split Pattern'.
 
* Example-1
Given the text "HELLO, WORLD!" and the split pattern AB, the
text would be split into two pieces.

 "HELLO," for A

 "WORLD!" for B

* Example-2
Given the text "HELLO, WORLD" and the split pattern AABBCC,
the text would be split into three pieces.

 "HELL" for A
 
 "O, W" for B

 "ORLD" for C


If the input is a matrix (several lines) the split pattern is 
applied onto the whole as one matrix.

* Example-3
Given the text "HELLO  and the split pattern AB, the text
                WORLD"
would be split into two pieces.

 "HE  for A
  WO" 

 "LLO for B
  RLD" 

* Example-4
Given the text "HELLO  and the split pattern A the text
                WORLD"                       B
would be split into two pieces.

 "HELLO" for A

 "WORLD" for B

* The task

Write a program - that given a block of text, and a split pattern,
will split the text into the appropriate geometric parts, with the
appropriate contents.

The rules for the Split Pattern are

* No same letters may appear with another letter in between. 
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AB
  AB
  AB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AB
  CB
  AB

* Only choerent rectangles or squares of the same letters are allowed
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  AAB
  AAB

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  AAB
  AAB
  BBB

* The split pattern must be an non-jagged matrix.
  Thus, this is a legal pattern

  ABB
  CCC

  and this is NOT a legal pattern

  ABB
  CC

* The dimensions of the pattern may never be greater than the dimensions of the
  text itself: Meaning, neither the amount of columns, or rows may be greater
  than the amount of rows and columns in the text. 
  Given "HELLO  - the dimensions of the text are (2 5) 2 rows, 5 columns
         WORLD"
  Thus, this is a legal pattern 

   AB

  and this is a legal pattern

   A
   B

  and this is NOT a legal pattern (3 1)

   A 
   B
   C

  likewise, this is also NOT a valid pattern (1 6)

   ABCDEF
